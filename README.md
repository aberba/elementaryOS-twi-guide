# elementary OS Twi Translation Guide

![elementary OS](images/elementary-os.png)

This is an effort to translate [elementary OS](https://elementary.io), a computer operating system, to Twi (Akan) which is commonly spoken in Ghana. This will hopefully make it easily accessible to the many locals who can only read or speak Twi.

You may read this [this blog](https://aberba.com/2020/translating-elementary-os-to-twi/) to learn more about why this is important. 

You can [contact me](https://github.com/aberba) if you would like to help out.

## Getting Started with the translation process
Make sure you are well fairly good in speaking, reading and writing Twi to be able to qualify for this task.

Also, it'll help to be familiar with basic terminologies like `Copy`, `Delete`, `Internet`, `Software`, `Hardware`, `Operating System`, `Computer Programming`, `Download` and several others commonly used when dealing with computers. This is important since software translation can be a little technical. The sentences and phrases you will be translating requires that **you know what they mean practically**.

With these in mind, here's how to get started in two easy steps:
1. Read the [elementary OS tranlation guide](https://elementary.io/docs/translation-guide#translation-guide) to familirarize yourself with the translation process.
2. Visit the elementary OS translation website, create an account, and start translating.

I have made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6M5AjwPmqHgx72Dgue4Hcb4dpnKfHbxV) on how to do this as well.

### How to be a good translator
* Do not do direct translation. Make sure your translation reads natural and easy understandable.
* Try your best to make translations phrases either less or equal to the length of the English version without loosing meaning and context.
